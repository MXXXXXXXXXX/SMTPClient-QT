A very simple implementation of SMTP protocol with SSL for Qt5
=======

## Description

An SMTP Client (including SSL/TLS for Gmail, etc) for Qt5.

## Features

- When using this with Gmail, you may find it useful to create an [app-specific password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en). You may also need to enable "[Less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en)", but try it without doing that first.

- When using this with qq mail or 163 mail, we need Client authorization code,due to this project is out of learning needs, so we just use this with Gmail.
